### Assignment 1
This assignment will give an introduction to basic image processing with python, filtering in the spatial domain, and a simple introduction to building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch.

### Assignment 2 
Classifying images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and how to use the frequency domain for image filtering.

### Assignment 3
Exploring how we can segment an image into foreground and background by using basic segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding and region growing.
Furthermore, using binary morphological operations to manipulate the contents of a binary image.
